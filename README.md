Project Description:

The dataset we are analyzing comes from the NYS government website (https://data.ny.gov/Education/Tuition-Assistance-Program-TAP-Recipients-Dollars-/2t78-bs45). This dataset, named "Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) Recipients & Dollars by Income, Age Group and Program Information," includes data on over 190,000 application types submitted to the TAP starting from the year 2000. Each of the 190,000 rows contains 16 features, such as academic year, age group, income, and total recipient dollars.

The goals for our data analysis include:
* Achieving an understanding of the different attributes that contribute to the grant award amount, and correlations that may exist between variables
* Building a model that can accurately predict, given a set of application data, the TAP grant award amount
* Observing trends or patterns in the application data that may inform of us any underlying changes in applications from the year 2000
